# Noshahi Property Website

This folder contains a full static starter for a property portal flow similar to Zameen-style architecture.

## Pages
- `index.html` - public website with homepage sections and advanced search filters
- `user-panel.html` - buyer/seller/agent role panel
- `agent-dashboard.html` - listing form, lead inbox, analytics blocks
- `admin-panel.html` - listing approvals, KPI cards, locations and content controls

## Key Features Implemented
- Hero search with major filters (city, area, type, buy/rent, price, bedrooms)
- Featured listings, projects, popular cities, blogs
- LocalStorage-based listing submission from agent dashboard
- Admin approve/reject workflow for pending listings
- Reused color scheme from your existing Noshahi style

## Run
1. Open `index.html` in browser.
2. Or run a local static server from this folder.

## Notes
- This is production-style frontend architecture with demo data.
- For real launch, connect APIs, authentication, payments, and database.
